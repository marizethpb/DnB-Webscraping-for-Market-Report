Did this first on Power Automate then tried doing it in Python too because:
  - not much flexibility on extraction by pages
  - I can't use my laptop when I run the flow
  - python is fun

The goal is to get data from the listed companies (classified as END USER) from different countries and industries
that would be used to make a market report for strategic planning of business. So, we need:
- Company name
- State
- Country
- Address
- Website

...other information such as contact number and annual sales would be gather from dnb finance analytics account 
(Next Repo)
